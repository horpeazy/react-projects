## About

This is a react application that demonstrates how to use the react hook useRef to manage the state of elements/nodes in web applications. useRef manages the state of elements in the tree without trigerring re- render itself which makes it powerful and efficient. The functionalities of useRef can be extended to build really complex applications. To test the application locally, follow the instructions below, there is a link to the site hosted on Netlify at the botton of this page.

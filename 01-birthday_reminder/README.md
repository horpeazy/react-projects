# Birthday Reminder

## About

This is a react application to demonstrate how the react hook useEffect can be used to manage state between renders. The application uses a mockup data to display the birthday of people and when the clear button is clicked, it changes the state of the list of birthdays and renders the page with the new state(empty) of the birthday list. To test the application locally, follow the instructions below, there is a link to the site hosted on Netlify at the botton of this page.
